HYPERTENSION TREATMENT PROTOCOL

Definition and Classification:
- Normal: <120/80 mmHg
- Elevated: 120-129/<80 mmHg
- Stage 1 HTN: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- Stage 2 HTN: ≥140/90 mmHg
- Hypertensive Crisis: >180/120 mmHg

Initial Assessment:
- Confirm diagnosis with multiple readings on separate occasions
- Assess cardiovascular risk factors
- Screen for secondary causes if indicated
- Baseline labs: BUN, creatinine, glucose, lipids, electrolytes
- ECG, urinalysis

Lifestyle Modifications (First-line for all patients):
- Weight reduction: Goal BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
- DASH diet: Rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy
- Sodium restriction: <2.3g daily, ideally <1.5g
- Alcohol limitation: ≤2 drinks/day men, ≤1 drink/day women
- Regular aerobic exercise: 90-150 minutes/week
- Smoking cessation

Pharmacological Treatment:

First-Line Agents:
1. ACE Inhibitors:
   - Lisinopril: 10mg daily, max 40mg daily
   - Enalapril: 5mg BID, max 20mg BID
   - Monitor: Cough (10%), hyperkalemia, angioedema (rare)

2. ARBs (if ACE inhibitor not tolerated):
   - Losartan: 50mg daily, max 100mg daily
   - Valsartan: 80mg daily, max 320mg daily
   - Monitor: Hyperkalemia, less cough than ACE inhibitors

3. Calcium Channel Blockers:
   - Amlodipine: 2.5-5mg daily, max 10mg daily
   - Nifedipine XL: 30mg daily, max 90mg daily
   - Monitor: Peripheral edema, gingival hyperplasia

4. Thiazide Diuretics:
   - Hydrochlorothiazide: 12.5-25mg daily
   - Chlorthalidone: 12.5-25mg daily (preferred)
   - Monitor: Hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia

Treatment Algorithms:

Stage 1 Hypertension (130-139/80-89):
- High CV risk: Start single agent
- Low-moderate CV risk: Lifestyle modifications x 3 months
- If goal not achieved: Add medication

Stage 2 Hypertension (≥140/90):
- Start with 2 agents from different classes
- Preferred combinations:
  * ACE inhibitor + thiazide diuretic
  * ARB + calcium channel blocker
  * ACE inhibitor + calcium channel blocker

Target Blood Pressures:
- General population: <130/80 mmHg
- Age ≥65 years: <130/80 mmHg (if tolerated)
- Diabetes: <130/80 mmHg
- CKD: <130/80 mmHg

Combination Therapy:
If single agent insufficient after 4-6 weeks:
- Add second agent from different class
- Consider fixed-dose combinations for adherence
- Avoid ACE inhibitor + ARB combination

Third-line agents:
- Spironolactone: 25mg daily (monitor K+, creatinine)
- Beta-blockers: Metoprolol 50mg BID, max 200mg BID
- Alpha-blockers: Doxazosin 1mg daily, max 16mg daily

Resistant Hypertension:
Definition: BP >130/80 on 3 antihypertensive agents including diuretic
Evaluation:
- Confirm medication adherence
- Check for secondary causes
- 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring
- Consider referral to hypertension specialist

Special Populations:

Pregnancy:
- First-line: Methyldopa 250mg BID-TID
- Second-line: Labetalol 100mg BID
- Avoid: ACE inhibitors, ARBs (teratogenic)
- Target: <140/90 mmHg

Heart Failure:
- Preferred: ACE inhibitor + beta-blocker + diuretic
- ARB if ACE inhibitor not tolerated
- Avoid: Non-dihydropyridine calcium blockers

Coronary Artery Disease:
- Preferred: Beta-blocker + ACE inhibitor
- Add calcium channel blocker if needed
- Target: <130/80 mmHg

Chronic Kidney Disease:
- Preferred: ACE inhibitor or ARB
- Monitor creatinine (acceptable increase <30%)
- Avoid potassium-sparing diuretics if K+ >5.0

Diabetes:
- Preferred: ACE inhibitor or ARB
- Add thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker
- Target: <130/80 mmHg

Monitoring:
- Follow-up in 1 month after initiation/dose change
- Once stable: Every 3-6 months
- Home BP monitoring encouraged
- Annual labs: Basic metabolic panel

Drug Interactions:
- NSAIDs: Reduce effectiveness of all antihypertensives
- Lithium: Thiazides and ACE inhibitors increase levels
- Potassium supplements: Monitor with ACE inhibitors/ARBs

Side Effects Management:
- ACE inhibitor cough: Switch to ARB
- Ankle edema (CCB): Add ACE inhibitor or reduce dose
- Fatigue (beta-blocker): Reduce dose or change agent
- Hypokalemia (diuretic): Add potassium or K+-sparing diuretic

Hypertensive Emergency:
- Immediate treatment if end-organ damage
- Goal: Reduce BP by 10-20% in first hour
- Agents: Nicardipine IV, labetalol IV, esmolol IV
- Avoid: Sublingual nifedipine (precipitous drop)

Follow-up Schedule:
- Initial visit: Confirm diagnosis, start treatment
- 1 month: Assess response, adjust therapy
- 3 months: Check labs, assess adherence
- Every 6 months: Ongoing monitoring if stable

This protocol should be individualized based on patient comorbidities and response to therapy.
