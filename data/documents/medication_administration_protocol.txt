- Involve parents/caregivers in education

Geriatric Patients:
- Start with lower doses ("start low, go slow")
- Monitor for polypharmacy interactions
- Assess for cognitive impairment affecting compliance
- Consider renal/hepatic function decline

Pregnant Patients:
- Verify pregnancy category for all medications
- Avoid teratogenic medications
- Consider breastfeeding implications
- Consult obstetrics for complex cases

ADVERSE DRUG REACTION REPORTING:

Immediate Actions:
1. Discontinue suspected medication
2. Assess patient condition and provide supportive care
3. Notify physician immediately

- Description of reaction and severity
- Treatment provided
- Patient outcome

Reporting:

PAIN MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS:

Pain Assessment:
- Use standardized pain scale (0-10 numeric scale)

- Consider non-verbal pain indicators in confused patients
- Document pain scores with vital signs

Opioid Administration:
- Assess respiratory rate before each dose
- Hold medication if respiratory rate <12/minute
- Monitor sedation level using Richmond scale
- Ensure naloxone (Narcan) readily available

Non-Pharmacological Interventions:
- Position changes and comfort measures
- Heat/cold therapy as appropriate
- Distraction techniques
- Relaxation and breathing exercises

CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE MANAGEMENT:

Storage Requirements:
- Secure in locked cabinet or automated dispensing system
- Limit access to authorized personnel only
