DIABETES MANAGEMENT CLINICAL GUIDELINE

Overview:
This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in adult patients.

Diagnosis Criteria:
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)
- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT
- HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
- Random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms

Initial Treatment Approach:

First-Line Therapy:
- Metformin 500-850mg twice daily (BID) with meals
- Start with 500mg BID, increase gradually to minimize GI side effects
- Maximum dose: 2000mg daily
- Contraindications: eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m², acute kidney injury

Lifestyle Modifications:
- Weight reduction: 5-10% of body weight if overweight
- Regular physical activity: 150 minutes/week moderate intensity
- Mediterranean or DASH diet pattern recommended
- Smoking cessation counseling

Second-Line Therapy Options:

If HbA1c remains >7% after 3 months of metformin:

1. SGLT2 Inhibitors (if eGFR >30):
   - Empagliflozin 10mg daily, may increase to 25mg
   - Canagliflozin 100mg daily, may increase to 300mg
   - Monitor for genital mycotic infections, UTIs

2. GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:
   - Liraglutide: Start 0.6mg daily x 1 week, then 1.2mg daily
   - Semaglutide: 0.25mg weekly x 4 weeks, then 0.5mg weekly
   - Check for personal/family history of medullary thyroid cancer

3. DPP-4 Inhibitors:
   - Sitagliptin 100mg daily (50mg if eGFR 30-50)
   - Linagliptin 5mg daily (no dose adjustment needed)

4. Sulfonylureas:
   - Glipizide 5mg daily initially, max 20mg daily
   - Monitor for hypoglycemia, especially in elderly

Insulin Therapy:

Indications for insulin:
- HbA1c >9% at diagnosis with symptoms
- Failure to achieve target with multiple oral agents
- Contraindications to other medications

Basal Insulin Protocol:
- Start with 10 units daily or 0.1-0.2 units/kg
- Adjust by 2-4 units every 3-4 days based on fasting glucose
- Target fasting glucose: 80-130 mg/dL

Monitoring:
- HbA1c every 3 months until stable, then every 6 months
- Annual eye exam, foot exam, nephropathy screening
- Blood pressure target: <130/80 mmHg
- LDL cholesterol target: <100 mg/dL (or <70 if CVD)

Hypoglycemia Management:
- Mild (glucose 54-70 mg/dL): 15g carbohydrates
- Severe (glucose <54 mg/dL): 20g carbohydrates
- Recheck in 15 minutes, repeat if needed

Special Populations:

Elderly Patients (>65 years):
- Less stringent HbA1c targets (7.5-8.5%)
- Avoid sulfonylureas if possible due to hypoglycemia risk
- Consider functional status and comorbidities

Pregnancy:
- Target fasting glucose: 70-95 mg/dL
- Target 1-hour postprandial: <140 mg/dL
- Target 2-hour postprandial: <120 mg/dL
- Insulin preferred over oral agents

Chronic Kidney Disease:
- Metformin contraindicated if eGFR <30
- Adjust medication doses based on kidney function
- Monitor for lactic acidosis

Drug Interactions:
- Metformin + Contrast: Hold 48 hours before/after contrast
- Warfarin + Sulfonylureas: Monitor INR closely
- Beta-blockers may mask hypoglycemia symptoms

Side Effects to Monitor:
- Metformin: Lactic acidosis (rare), GI upset, B12 deficiency
- SGLT2 inhibitors: UTIs, genital infections, DKA
- GLP-1 agonists: Nausea, pancreatitis (rare)
- Insulin: Hypoglycemia, weight gain

Emergency Situations:
- DKA: pH <7.3, glucose >250 mg/dL, ketones present
- HHS: Glucose >600 mg/dL, severe dehydration, altered mental status
- Severe hypoglycemia: Glucagon 1mg IM/SC if conscious level impaired

Quality Metrics:
- HbA1c <7% for most adults
- Blood pressure <130/80 mmHg
- LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL
- Annual eye and foot exams completed
- Nephropathy screening annually

This guideline should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and individualized patient care.
