# Health-Care-Q-A-assistance

A powerful RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system built with LangChain for healthcare professionals to query medical guidelines, hospital policies, and drug information.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Upload and process PDF documents containing medical guidelines
- **Vector Search**: FAISS-powered semantic search for relevant document chunks
- **RAG Pipeline**: LangChain-based retrieval and generation system
- **Healthcare-Focused**: Optimized for medical terminology and healthcare workflows
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction

## Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: RAG pipeline framework
- **FAISS**: Vector database for document embeddings
- **Streamlit**: Web interface
- **OpenAI/Hugging Face**: Language models
- **PyPDF2**: PDF document processing

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
